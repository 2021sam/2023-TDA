Solution:
5. Update SSL certificate with certifi (MacOS only)

All we would have to do is to run command with the following piece of code:

- Press "command + space" button or open Spotlight
- type "Install Certificates.command" 
What this command does is update our systemâ€™s SSL certificate directory for MacOS.


psql

DROP TABLE stock;

CREATE TABLE stock (

    symbol varchar(4)
);
